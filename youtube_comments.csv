"Kyle, you&#39;re also one of the few youtubers who actually includes the materials referenced in the video in the description! I know it&#39;s an easy thing to forget, but I appreciate the attention to detail :)"
"In 6 minutes you covered basically everything you need to know about fetch! I love how explained the corner cases for every line (like why we use JSON.stringify or how .catch() only catches fetch-related errors) potentially saving us from many unexplained bugs and sleepless nights! Thank you so much, Kyle! You&#39;re the GOAT!"
"I&#39;ve just switched from basic Java OOP (mostly playing around with data types) to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, until this point, I get frustrated with all the confusing Javascript syntax, the way the functions are used, the stupidly ignorant way to declare variables (why the FCK can&#39;t we set specific datatype to variables???), the way things get overly dependent on each other, like &quot;if you want to get this data from this URL, you have to set this up, but wait, you have to do this first, hold on,...&quot;. There are still a ton of things you have to do before you can achieve a simple operation. Anyway, I&#39;m still trying to get all of this shit into my brain. Fck Javascript."

Hey thanks for making this video! Needed the help! Can you also explain where you&#39;re fetching this data from (reqres link - what exactly is it? why did you choose it?) and how do we decide from where can we make fetches?
hi
"thanks man, I was so confused why api error would return a success case, now I get it"
"well explained, thanks for the efforts."
I dont understand why the lectures like this always explains how it is not working.......just explain how it is done.
Fucking fantastic. Wow. Thanks for being pragmatic man.

Really helpfull. How can i make it printed on webpage?
Is there a solution for &#39;has been blocked by CORS policy&#39; error in this method?
This is great but how does one return the JSON data such that we can use .map against it? I can easily return a promise. I&#39;m coming from a Python/C background and trying to learn web-app things and I feel like a complete noob again.
how do i flatten the data if want i want to display is nested further in?
"Wow I understood this in 6 minutes, amazing"

you&#39;re the man
how do you set up VS Code like you have here to show in the browser console in real time the output from the code on the left? Every time I&#39;ve tried it I get some error about not being able to connect to or find the debuggee. I&#39;m trying this in (late) 2022 with Firefox as my default browser. I can build and run stuff in VS Code but can&#39;t debug a web app from it. Thanks
Where would you put an access header with api key
how do i get the error message in my catch? it only returns the status
great job man
Brilliant video!!
WHEN I FETCH IT SAYS ACCESS DENIED AND I DONT KNOW HOW TO USE THE API KEY TO ACCESS IT. I WAS FOLLOWING YOUR VIDEO ON CURRENCY CONVERTER AND I HAD TO STOP BECAUSE I DIDN GET ACCESS TO THE API
"Hi,<br><br>How would I go about grabbing a value from the database and setting a variable equal to it to use later in my code? This video outputs to console just fine but any time i try assigning to variable it comes back as undefined or a promise. I might be missing something but i&#39;ve been on this all day trying to find an answer."
"Sometimes it takes someone to use slightly different words in order for the explanation to land. I think you have a gift. Well done on this video, and step by step explaining the double promise in fetch. Also, simply by saying &quot;you can use asynce/await OR then&quot; you put so much clarity into my mind. Keep going."
Thank Kyle! You were very helpful as always! You&#39;re very pedagogue
How can I assign the value from api response to a variable in second .then() When I&#39;m logging value of variable it is always showing the initial value and not the api response which is being assigned

this guy is so handsome
The perfect explanation. long live mate. you are probably the best and the most thorough professional who has the ability to explain in accurate details.
What&#39;s missing from this tutorial is how to handle the server side of the transaction.<br>I&#39;m using Node JS and the thing thinks I&#39;m trying to send HTNL data instead of JSON.<br>Modern web technology is broken and needs rebuilt from the ground up.
All the videos are just a few steps ahead of beginner level. Also with code you need those steps to make the project work. Good information but I already know when clicking on these videos there will be critical information missing.

I think in the .then&#39;s anonymous callback you do not need to use return on res.json() because it is implicit for an arrow function expression consisting of a one line body.

"Question: Why do we need to actually need to use the word, &quot;return&quot;, at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuEtnrL9-H0&amp;t=5m12s"">5:12</a> for the res.json()? In earlier parts of the video, it seemed fine to just have .then(res =&gt; res.json()) instead of .then(res =&gt; return res.json()). Any clarity is much appreciated! Loved this video, super helpful in explaining everything. This was the only thing I had a question on."
"txz, what about put and delete methods?"

"Ugh been trying to figure out how to access this api <a href=""https://tracker.gg/developers/docs"">https://tracker.gg/developers/docs</a> maybe you could make a video on how to do this with a basic html, css and javascript setup and work with this api locally on your machine using live server ect."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuEtnrL9-H0&amp;t=3m52s"">3:52</a> console.elon()"

Thank you. Great tutorial! Any beginner Fetch API Tutorials for displaying random images?
"I&#39;m alittle confused here: in this statement: .then(res =&gt; console.log(res)), isn&#39;t res =&gt; the parameter used in the function, when written in arrow function syntax? but why you said that res is the response object? can you explain to me? thanks!"

How do you save the json result as a json file if sending a get?
You have very helpful videos Kyle!<br>I do want to ask how you would use fetch for just getting raw HTML from any webpage? So you could parse it with Cheerio and offer the content in your own app. So webscraping actually. Thank you if anybody has an answer!
"Man I want to kiss you, thank you so much!!!"
"Not exactly what I was looking for, but this is a great Video indeed."

I&#39;m already enrolled in another course, but if I&#39;m not satisfied with what I&#39;m going to learn about react I&#39;ll check out your course on that - I like the way you describe things so it&#39;s easy to understand of how it all comes together."
Clear and concise. It would be great if you can explain how to send form data using the FormData object too and any alternate ways of sending form data to an endpoint
Subscribed.   The tips presented are well and useful.  What&#39;s the model of your webcast microphone?  The audio is really good and your voice is easy to the ears.
MVP video.
If anyone knows how to display the data from the api to html

I&#39;m new to promises so I have some questions: how should this be refactored with async/await; and how does data =&gt; console.log(data) work? Its working no matter what I write in place of &quot;data&quot;. It seems similar to forEach but I still don&#39;t get it.
excellent thank you

"Hii Kyle,<br><br>I have a doubt,we don&#39;t we return res.json()  in the GET METHOD and why do we return res.json() in POST method.<br>Would be grateful if you clarify this point"
THIS is how you teach
"At the end you said something along &quot;You can&#39;t send a JavaScript Object, you need to covert it into a JSON&quot;, which is tricky wording considering a JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation."
Whos learning new skill in this qaurantine?
"is it possible to take out the received response data and store it a variable and use it in some other function..<br>for example:<br>var temp;<br>fetch(&#39;some url&#39;)<br>.then(function(res){<br>    return res.json();<br>})<br>.then(function(data){<br>    temp = data;<br>    return data;<br>})<br>.catch(function(err){<br>    console.log(err);<br>});<br><br>is this a correct format?"
